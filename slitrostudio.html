    <header> <h1>What is Slitro Studio?</h1> </header>
<body>
    <h2>Thanks for asking!</h2>
    <p>I honestly have no clue where this is headed… but that’s half the fun. Your guesses are welcome.</p>
    <p>Got ideas? Send them my way at hey@slitrostudio.me</p>
    <p>Heres what I know so far: Slitro Studio is a hub for digital projects, chaotic experiments, and whatever else doesn’t fit anywhere else.</p>
    <p> Think of it as glue holding together things that should not be glued.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: Slitro Studio stands for "Slightly Nitro Studio"</p>
